# BaseCard

The `BaseCard` component is designed to provide a flexible and customizable container for various content types. It serves as the foundational block for building card-based user interfaces, supporting a range of layouts and styles.

## Usage

`BaseCard` is a versatile component that can be used in numerous contexts where card-based layouts are appropriate. It can hold a variety of content, from text and images to custom components.

### Guidelines:

- **Modularity**: Use `BaseCard` in combination with its subcomponents like `BaseCard.Header` and `BaseCard.Body` to maintain a modular structure.
- **Customization**: Leverage the `sx` prop to apply custom styles and adapt the card to different design requirements.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that all content within the `BaseCard` is accessible and navigable.

## Basic BaseCard

Demonstrate a simple card with minimal content to showcase the basic layout and styling capabilities.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## BaseCard with Header and Icon

Illustrate how an icon, such as a question mark, can be included in the header for additional context or functionality.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.WithHeaderAndIcon} />
</Canvas>

## Custom Styled BaseCard

Illustrate how the `BaseCard` can be customized using the `sx` prop for specific styling needs.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.CustomStyled} />
</Canvas>
