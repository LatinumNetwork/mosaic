# CardHeader

The `CardHeader` component is designed to provide a consistent and customizable header section for card components. It can accommodate a wide range of content, including titles, icons, and action elements, offering flexibility and adaptability for various card designs.

## Usage

`CardHeader` can be used in any card component where you need to display a header. It supports custom children, allowing you to add text, buttons, icons, or any other elements that suit your design needs.

### Guidelines:

- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent design across different cards using the `CardHeader`.
- **Flexibility**: Utilize the ability to pass custom children to create diverse and dynamic header designs.
- **Readability**: Ensure that the header content is clear and easily readable.

## Basic Card Header

Showcase a header with both a title and additional content like a subtitle or a small description.

  <Story of={Stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## Card Header with Actions

Include interactive elements such as buttons or icons in the header for added functionality.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={Stories.WithAdditionalContent} />
