# Button

The `Button` component is an enhanced version of the Material UI Button. It provides six distinct variants:

- `Primary`: A solid button used for primary actions.
- `Secondary`: An outlined button used for secondary actions.
- `Tertiary`: A button with subtle borders, used for tertiary actions.
- `Text`: A button that appears like a regular text but performs as a button.
- `Link`: A button that appears like a link, suitable for navigation purposes.
- `Nav`: A button with no background or border that changes color when active, suitable for navigation bars.

Each variant has three size options: small, medium, and large.

The `Button` component allows the use of colors placed into the theme's palette. See the color docs to see all the color palette.
