### Sandbox

This is where the component will actually be rendered with [interactive controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls/). There should be a control
for each prop that someone can change (i.e. background color, border color, width, or whatever else is appropriate for a given
component).

```
<Canvas>
  <Story name="Sandbox">{component}</Story>
</Canvas>
```
